# About
> 32-Bit general purpose MIPS-like processor with RISC-like ISA Code of the processor is written using VHDL then synthesized and implemented on Xilinx ISE program. The processor is then tested with simple factorial calculator on simulation in Xilinx ISE program it consists of 3 main parts:
1. VHDL in this part the code of the processor was written then synthesized on Xilinx ISE program.
2. Assembler Written in C program takes the assembly code as text file of the application and output the binary which is then used in processor.
3. PCB.
